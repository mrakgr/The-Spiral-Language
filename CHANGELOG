2.4.21 (9/19/2023)

* Changed the way the unions are generated so the return type errors in the HLS C++ compiler are avoided.

2.4.20 (9/18/2023)

* A significant number of changes related to how union types are compiled. The constructors/assignment operators will now get generated from them in the C++ backend.
* Also changed the way closure arguments work. It should be much easier to use them for C++ interop.

2.4.19 (9/14/2023)

* Final bit of wrangling. I've removed ESBuild and Typescript as dependencies so they aren't getting packaged with the Spiral plugin anymore.
* I won't bother trying to get the build systems to work anymore, I opened an issue on ESBuild as to why it is not bundling the `ws` package.

2.4.14-18 (9/14/2023)

* Trying to get the ESBuild to work.
* It only works if the node_modules folder is present in the extension. What a waste of time this was.

2.4.13 (9/14/2023)

Type level artithmetic support.

* Adjusted the printing of type literals so backticks are being output in the infer and partial eval phases.
* Modified TypeLitToLit op so it evaluates the nominal wrappers to literals. This allows the language to support type level arithmetic operations.
* Did a similar thing for the HLS C++ backend. Now splicing type lits in macros will work correctly.
* The other backends don't support it yet.

2.4.12 (9/8/2023)

* Added the missing case in unify for type literals.

2.4.11 (9/8/2023)

* Fixed a bug in nominals with unit bodies.
* Fixed the incorrect return type being assigned in nominal constructor functions.

2.4.10 (9/8/2023)

* Fixed an error when infering the or cases in the type inferencer.

2.4.9 (9/6/2023)

Minor HLS C++ backend bugfixes.

* String is now `const char *` instead of a `char *`

2.4.8 (9/6/2023)

Minor HLS C++ backend bugfixes.

* Fixed the invalid method names on the C backend.
* Adjusted the backend so it forward generates the functions.
* Moved forward declarations below the type declarations.

2.4.7 (8/29/2023)

* Also, fixed the erronous package existence regression.

2.4.6 (8/29/2023)

* Removed the print statement left in by accident.

2.4.5 (8/29/2023)

* Fixed the issue where writing a module called 'con' would cause the language server to deadlock.

2.4.4 (8/29/2023)

* Loosened the restriction on returning void in the HLS C++ backend.
* Also added the printing of the array type.
* Lightened up the imports in the C++ backend it doesn't need many of the C backend ones.
* Extended the type parser so it parser default literals.
* Fixed the overeager metavars assertion bug in nested functions.

2.4.3 (1/24/2023)

* Created the HLS C++ backend.

2.4.2 (1/24/2023)

* Finished adding the type level literals to the language.

2.4.1 (1/23/2023)

* Added a 1s sleep when restarting the server using a command.

2.4.0 (1/23/2023)

* Replaced ZeroMQ with SignalR in the language server. Now it is compatible with the latest VS version.

2.3.10 (1/18/2023)

* Fixed a bug in constraint process where kind checking was not being done for nested metavars.

2.3.9 (1/17/2023)

* The constraints have kinds now.
* Fixed the way the contraints work. Now the type system should be sound.
* Made a small speed tweak in the inferencer.

2.3.8 (1/14/2023)

* Added the `uint` constraint to the language.
* Added duplicate constraint checking in the parser.
* Changed the type signatures of the array functions in the core library so that the `dim` type variable has the {number; int} constraint instead of just {number}.
* Removed the unapplied typevar check in the constraint processor.
* Fixed an error where the nested contraints were not propagated fully.

2.3.7 (1/5/2023)

Another significant redesign of the C ref counting backend. Tail recursive loops will be maximally efficient. Will be suitable for multithreaded code if atomics are brought in. Also the old version was broken when duplicate variables are passed into closure calls.

* Grammar fix to the v$ macro error message, as well as a small efficiency improvement in string building.
* Fixed the missing semicolon in the TyFailwith case.

2.3.6 (1/1/2023)

* Expanded the v$ macro in the C backend a bit.

2.3.5 (12/31/2022)

* Added the SizeOf op to the language.
* Modified the way Int32 and UInt32 literals are printed back to how they were before.
* Added a check when applying prototype instances.
* Added the FreeVars op to the language

2.3.4 (12/29/2022)

* Extended VarTag so it reaches into the nominal.
* Fixed `FunctionTermSlotsGet`.

2.3.3 (12/28/2022)

* Added some new serialization ops to core_real. `FunctionTermSlotsSet`, `FunctionTermSlotsGet` and `FunctionIs`.

2.3.2 (12/28/2022)

* Fixed a critical bug in Infer regarding how recursive inl statements are annotated.
* The UPMEM C backend will now use `buddy_alloc` and `buddy_free` instead of the standard C `malloc` and `free`.

2.3.1 (12/27/2022)

Created the UPMEM: Python + C backend for Spiral. Removed the Cython backend. The efficiency of compiled union patterns has been largely improved. 

* A bug where union and regular patterns couldn't be mixed has been fixed.
* Macros can now be started with an apostrophe. For example: $'qwe' is the same as $"qwe".
* Various minor under the hood improvements.

2.3.0 (12/21/2022)

Created the Python backend for Spiral.

* Optimized the EQ and NEQ case in the partial evaluator.

2.2.7 (12/21/2022)

* Added minor unused var optimization in union unboxing.

2.2.5/2.2.6 (12/20/2022)

* Some more work on ref counting part of the C backend. The semantics have changed - trying to read from unitialized arrays will cause null pointer fault now.
* Accidentally published as 2.2.6 on OVSX, so I'll skip a patch version next time. 2.2.6 is the same as 2.2.5.

2.2.4 (12/18/2022)

* Redesigned how ref counting works in the C backend. Fixed a bug related to increfing not happening at the ends of if branches.

2.2.3 (7/22/2022)

* Fixed a C backend bug related to arrays.

2.2.2 (7/17/2022)

* Ordered the fields from largest to smallest in tuple, closure and layout structs.

2.2.1 (7/15/2022)

* Fixed the string length bug in C backend. The null character was being counted incorrectly.

2.2.0 (7/13/2022)

Created the C backend for Spiral.

* This involved making some changes in `seq_apply` in the partial evaluator module which will affect the other codegens, so the resulting code will be more verbose.
* Since it creates extra statements for strings, the Cython backend will be a bit slower too.

2.1.11 (8/24/2021)

* Fixed the broken bitwise ops in the F# codegen.

2.1.10 (8/24/2021)

* Added the Conv op.

2.1.9 (8/22/2021)

* Missed an edge case in the previous fix.

2.1.8 (8/22/2021)

* Fixed a minor editor support regression is macro tokenization.

2.1.7 (8/21/2021)

* Default int for the real segment is i32 again.
* Added the `iam` (inverse array) module to the core library.
* Change record_foldl and record_foldr, to record_fold and record_fold_back so they match F#'s naming scheme rather than Haskell's. Ditto for record_type.

2.1.6 (8/18/2021)

Fsharp codegen fixes.

* I was surprised to find the F# compiler not accepting empty records as valid types. Fixed.
* Indexing into unit record fields no longer produces useless `()`s in the generated code so it looks nicer.
* Simplified the way 32 bit arrays are created in generated code.

2.1.5 (8/17/2021)

* Fixed the crash bug during type inference of mutually recursive unions.

2.1.4 (8/15/2021)

Finishing what I started yesterday.

* Prototypes functions now show comments on hover.
* Improved the way comments are printed in module hover.
* Fixed a bug in type annotations involving modules.
* Result of a symbol application show up on hover in type annotations.

2.1.3 (8/14/2021)

User experience improvements.

* Literal suffixes are colored as keywords instead of numbers. This makes it easier to distinguish them from the actual number.
* !! and `` are valid syntax in macros.
* Module entries get printed on a separate lines instead of like records.
* Unapplied modules show up on hover.
* The result of a record application shows up when hovering over the symbol.
* Function comments show up on module hover.
* Comments get printed similarly to in Python. Newlines are erased, and empty lines are instead printed as newlines.

2.1.2 (8/13/2021)

* Module indexing in nominal patterns.

2.1.1 (8/8/2021)

* The type hover inside a list has been fixed. I introduced a regression while doing 2.1.0.

2.1.0 (8/6/2021)

* Major change: Removed the symbol paired pattern and related renamings for it from the language due to it being an eyesore and causing confusion.
* Major change: The union pattern syntax is now like F#'s. The argument to the union can be ommitted in which case it is assumed to be wildcard. `| Some => ...` is the same as `| Some _ => ...`.
* Minor change: Removed the record paired symbol application that I haven't used even once.
* Minor change: Removed core and replaced it with core2.
* Minor change: Instead of the paired symbol pattern, the Record ops now use records. The same goes for core functions in general.
* Patch: Added the `limit` module and removed `limit_min` and `limit_max` modules from core.

This update does not add anything to the language and just gets rid of the low quality experimental syntax. It only increased the complexity of the language and just made the implementation more difficult along with causing ambiguity for the user. Now the variables you type are the variables that are under the hood. No more spurious renaming. The paired symbol pattern would have made some sense if I was doing programming in the bottom up where records are leaky, but I am doing so little programming in that part that it does not matter.

The record symbol application was already broken as it is due to the inference engine not being able to fill in the type variables during module application. Along with it not being used, it is prime material for the chopping block.

The design of Spiral should be fairly vanilla now and that is good. I've been comparing the ease of use of Spiral to F# and Python, and the extra bit of complexity the paired symbol pattern introduced pushed Spiral into negative. Writing Spiral code should feel smoother now. Later on, not having to deal with this complexity will make it easier to implement autocomplete and renaming.

Fixing the library and the project I am working on is easy, but what will I do about the docs? Being the only user does not give me much incentive to work on it, so I'll leave a note that the symbol paired pattern no longer works in the news.

2.0.92 (7/6/2021)

* Added the signed int (sint) constraint into the language.

2.0.91 (7/2/2021)

* Fixed a bug in array `filter` and `choose`.

2.0.90 (7/2/2021)

* Fixed a variable shadowing bug when filling in the type annotation of default values in patterns.

2.0.89 (7/1/2021)

* Added `clear` to the `rm` module.
* Extended the PrintStatic op so it can print raw types.
* Adjusted the F# and the Cython codegen so that the floats get printed without loss of precision.

2.0.88 (6/15/2021)

* I was too hasty in fixing the codegen bug and introduced a performance bug instead. Now it should be fixed properly.

2.0.87 (6/15/2021)

* Fixed the length Cython codegen bug when using arrays other than u64/i64.

2.0.86 (6/8/2021)

* Renamed array's iter2i to iteri2 so it matches the F# naming scheme.
* Added `3` and `4` versions of `map` and `iter` function into the array module.
* Since tail recursive loops keep stack overflowing in Cython, the array module now uses the imperative while loops instead.
* Added `CythonToNamedTuple` op, the `record` constraint and fixed the lack of dyning bug in `CythonToRecord`'s partial evaluation case.
* Added the `namedtuple` function to core. This should help Python interop as it provides a succinct way of converting Spiral records into Python objects.
* `except *` now does not get generated on main functions returning objects. The Cython codegen is a rat's nest of hacks due to all the non-composable features of Cython.
* Changed the semantics of the Cython codegen so closure arguments now behave like those for regular join points. This should make interop easier.
* For unknown reasons, the language server will sometimes rarely miss a heartbeat and terminate. I haven't resolved the reason for that yet, but the `Restart Server` command should now work properly as it will clear the previous request instead of waiting for it to finish.

2.0.85 (5/22/2021)

Minor fixes. I'll start keeping a changelog from here as development on the compiler has stabilized. For the previous versions, the commit history can serve as the changelog. I have a bunch of stuff on the TODO list, but don't have much drive to work on them at this time. At this point the compiler itself is good enough.

* Added mapi and mapi2 to the `am` module of the `core2` package.
* Fixed filter so it passes the actual element instead of the index.
